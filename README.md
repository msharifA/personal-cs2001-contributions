## Prerequisites

  

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

  

- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) (version 11 or higher)

- [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/)

  

## Cloning the Repository

  

First, clone the repository to your local machine.

  

## Running the backend (spring boot)

Navigate to the backend directory:

> **cd reusemedb** and run the **ReusemedbApplication.java** file directly from
> your IDE.

  

## Running the Frontend (React)

Navigate to the frontend directory:
